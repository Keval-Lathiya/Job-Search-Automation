# # Job Notifications Automation
# 
# ## Automate Your Job Search: Let Python Handle It!
# 
# #### This Python script scrapes job listings from job boards and notifies you via WhatsApp if your desired job is posted within a specified time frame. I prefer to receive notifications every morning at 9 AM, so Iâ€™ve scheduled this script using Windows Task Scheduler to run automatically every day at that time and send me the results.
# 
# ### How to Schedule the Script in Task Scheduler:
# 
# 1. Open Task Scheduler.
# 2. Select "Create Basic Task" from the "Actions" menu.
# 3. Name your task and provide a description, then click "Next."
# 4. Set the frequency of the task, then click "Next" and specify the time.
# 5. Choose "Start a program" and click "Next."
# 6. Browse to the location of your Python executable:
#    - If you're unsure where it's located, press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, then type `where python` in the command prompt.
# 7. In the "Add arguments" field, enter the path to your script (e.g., `"C:\Users\keval\OneDrive\Desktop\Python\Job_Automation.py"`).
# 8. Click "Finish" to complete the setup.
# 
# ### Setting up Twilio for WhatsApp notifications is straightforward. Visit [twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com) to get a WhatsApp number, `account_sid`, and `auth_token`
