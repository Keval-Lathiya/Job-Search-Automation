    "#### This Python script scrapes job listings from job boards and notifies you via WhatsApp if your desired job is posted within a specified time frame. I prefer to receive notifications every morning at 9 AM, so Iâ€™ve scheduled this script using Windows Task Scheduler to run automatically every day at that time and send me the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Schedule the Script in Task Scheduler:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open Task Scheduler.\n",
    "2. Select \"Create Basic Task\" from the \"Actions\" menu.\n",
    "3. Name your task and provide a description, then click \"Next.\"\n",
    "4. Set the frequency of the task, then click \"Next\" and specify the time.\n",
    "5. Choose \"Start a program\" and click \"Next.\"\n",
    "6. Browse to the location of your Python executable:\n",
    "   - If you're unsure where it's located, press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, then type `where python` in the command prompt.\n",
    "7. In the \"Add arguments\" field, enter the path to your script (e.g., `\"C:\\Users\\keval\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Python\\Job_Automation.py\"`).\n",
    "8. Click \"Finish\" to complete the setup.\n",

    "### Setting up Twilio for WhatsApp notifications is straightforward. Visit [twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com) to get a WhatsApp number, `account_sid`, and `auth_token`\n",
